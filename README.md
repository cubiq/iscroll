iScroll v4.1.9 - 2011-09-22
===========================

The overflow:scroll for mobile webkit. Project started because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size (width/height) div. So basically it was impossible to have a fixed header/footer and a scrolling central area. Until now. Read more at [cubiq.org](http://cubiq.org).

## Ender support
Using [Ender](http://ender.no.de), add it to your existing build

    $ ender add iscroll

Use it like this:

``` js
var myScroll = $('#doc').iScroll(options)
```
